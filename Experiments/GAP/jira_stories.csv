https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1B5g3Iv6rUufoGzO9rwHF3_e-gW1gXxojjwPAU2FKxTo/edit#slide=id.p

During the migration to the new pattern, there are additional opportunities to improve the tests:

* review all step definitions and look for opportunities to consolidate, or make them more sensible
* always consider each section from the user perspective, and provide commands which mimic what the user can do
* make commands short and simple
* make sure commands do things efficiently. excessive calls to the selenium/webdriver API are fragile and time consuming
* if a selector is too crazy, update zing-web to make it more sensible
* include more helpful messages when steps fail! (http://nightwatchjs.org/api/#waitForElementVisible)

It is also useful to plan out the functionality a section provides before implementing it in code.",,jmatos,,,,,,ZING-1365,,,,01/Jan/18 8:48 AM,,,,QA automated,,0|u007js:,3,,,,Ticket Healthy,,0|i07xvz:,,,
Rework storage of credentials in Jenkins for End-to-end (E2E) tests,ZING-1211,62216,,Story,Backlog,ZING,ZING,software,ian,P3,,,morr,morr,01/Oct/18 10:14 AM,30/Nov/18 9:12 AM,30/Mar/19 9:25 PM,,,,,0,e2e,,,"The end-to-end (E2E) tests use multiple sets of user credentials to test permissions. Currently, there are two sets of credentials, which are stored in the Jenkins credentials manager as username/password credentials.

It is expected that the number of credentials required will expand as RBAC functionality develops. To facilitate updates of tests, it has been suggested that we rework the tests and the test runner to put all of those credentials in a single json file, which is then stored as a 'secret file' in the Jenkins credentials manager. This will necessitate changing the tests to read and parse a file, and then updating the test runner to rework the storage and to pass the file to the tests.",,morr,,,,,,,,,,,,,,QA needed,,0|u0054w:,3,,,,Ticket Healthy,,0|i07vfj:,,,
